# About me

My name is Sophie Robert and SHAMan is developed as a tool for [my PhD thesis](http://www.theses.fr/s216120) on the auto-tuning of supercomputers. My academic laboratory is the [Li-PARAD](http://www.liparad.uvsq.fr/) located in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France. My research is partially funded by the [Atos company](http://atos.net) and I work most of the time in their R&D quarter in Echirolles, France.

If you have any enquiries regarding my work, you can contact me at <sophie.robert@atos.net>.
