# About the authors

My name is Sophie Robert and SHAMan is developed as a tool for [my PhD thesis](http://www.theses.fr/s216120) on the auto-tuning of supercomputers. My academic laboratory is the [Li-PARAD](http://www.liparad.uvsq.fr/) located in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France, where I am supervised by Dr Soraya Zertal. My research is partially funded by the [Atos company](http://atos.net) and I work most of the time in their R&D quarter in Echirolles, France, under the supervision of Philippe Couvée and Dr Grégory Vaumourin. I'd also like to give a special thanks to [Dr Gaël Goret](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaelgoret) for his advisory role in my research project and without whom SHAMan would have never taken its first baby steps. UI and logo are designed by [Sébastien Bakirci](https://sebastienbakirci.myportfolio.com/).
